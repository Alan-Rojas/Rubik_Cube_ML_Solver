# Rubik_Cube_ML_Solver
Create a machine learning algorithm that can solve a Rubik cube of 3x3x3 dimensions. 



# How?

Using tensors we will represent the cube in a digital space. Defining its possible movements as operations with these tensors. 

Then, we will define the restrictions of the cube: One movement at a time, only rows, columns and faces can move, the cube strating pos is unsolved, and the final pos is solved. 

We will use different search algorithms to reach solutions. 

# If successful

It will be considerated creating an AI to solve the cube: learning with each interaction better ways to solve the cube, with reinforcement learning.
